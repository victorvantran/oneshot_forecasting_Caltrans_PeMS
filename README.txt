-------------------------------------------------
Anaconda Environment Setup
-------------------------------------------------
I used a Anaconda Environment for TensorFlow by following this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHWkvEcDBO0&ab_channel=AladdinPersson
	I installed Tensorflow v2.6.0 and Python 3.9.0

Auxillairy packages need to be installed as needed in the Anaconda environment



-------------------------------------------------
PyCharm
-------------------------------------------------
We will be using PyCharm for our environment setup, as followed by the tutorial video mentioned above
Place the /dataset, /preprocessed_data, main.py, and PeMS.py directories and files into your PyCharm project


-------------------------------------------------
preprocessed_data and dataset Directories
-------------------------------------------------
Note that the directories in /preprocessed_data and /dataset are empty.
The actual directories are made public on a dropbox due to its large size. Download them and replace the empty directories
